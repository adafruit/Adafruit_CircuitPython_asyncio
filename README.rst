Cooperative multitasking and asynchronous I/O

The code in this library is largely based on the
`MicroPython uasyncio implementation <https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/extmod/uasyncio>`_.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

.. todo:: Describe the Adafruit product this library works with. For PCBs, you can also add the
image from the assets folder in the PCB's GitHub repo.

`Purchase one from the Adafruit shop <http://www.adafruit.com/products/>`_


Installing from PyPI
=====================
.. note:: This library is not available on PyPI yet. Install documentation is included
   as a standard element. Stay tuned for PyPI availability!

.. todo:: Remove the above note if PyPI version is/will be available at time of release.

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-asyncio/>`_.
To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-asyncio

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-asyncio

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-asyncio



Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install asyncio

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update

Usage Example
=============

.. todo:: Add a quick, simple example. It and other examples should live in the
examples folder and be included in docs/examples.rst.
