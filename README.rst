Cooperative multitasking and asynchronous I/O

The code in this library is largely based on the
`MicroPython uasyncio implementation <https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/extmod/uasyncio>`_.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Ticks <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Ticks>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.


Installing from PyPI
=====================
This library is meant to be a subset of the ` ``asyncio`` module in CPython
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_, and will not be made available on PyPI.
Use the CPython version instead.


Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install asyncio

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update
